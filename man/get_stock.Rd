\title{Calculate stock measures from V-Dem data.}
\usage{
get_stock(
  var = "v2x_polyarchy",
  val = 0.99,
  fill = 5,
  add = NULL,
  name = "v.dem.out"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{The V-Dem variables you wish to calculate a stock measure from. 
The default is the Electoral Democracy Index (v2x_polyarchy). 
A stock variable is calculated for each element of var.
(Note: each variable in var is first normalized to be between 0 and 1.)\cr}

\item{val}{The weights to apply to the cumulative sum of past values. The 
default weight is 0.99. A stock variable is calculated for each element of 
var and val. \cr
(Note: the weight must be between 0 and 1 or will receive an error message.)}

\item{fill}{The number of years to fill forward missing values. 
The default is five years. To prevent values being filled forward, use 'fill=0'\cr 
(Note: the fill value must be a single whole number greater than or equal to 
zero or will return an error message.)\cr}

\item{add}{Any additional V-Dem variables you wish added to the output dataset.\cr
Names must match variables names in the V-Dem dataset.}

\item{name}{An optional name for the output. The default name is 'v.dem.out'.\cr
(Note: re-running the command without specifying a name for the new output 
will result in previous output being rewritten.)}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the original V-Dem variable(s), their stock 
measure(s) at each specified weight, along with country-year identifiers and 
any user-specified additional variables from the V-Dem dataset.
}
\description{
This package allows you to generate a cumulative weighted sum of past values 
for any V-Dem variable with user-defined weights. The resulting measure is 
re-scaled to represent the share of the total possible stock the country 
could have accumulated up until that year. 
The package uses the latest version of the data loaded by the 
vdemdata R package.
The function generates a data frame containing a number of stock variables 
equal to length(var)*length(val). Specifying multiple elements in var and val 
will result in higher computational time. If your machine is slower or you 
specify many elements in var and val, be prepared to wait for the data to process.
